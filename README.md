# CMPE--256_Project - Work-Life Balance during COVID19 Pandemic

### **HappyDB: Work-Life Balance during COVID19 Pandemic** :mask:
This project describes HappyDB and its properties and outlines several important NLP problems that
can be studied with the help of the corpus. Additionally, this paper tries to incorporate the dataset as a reference for
Work-Life-Balance in the time of a pandemic as COVID19. Our results demonstrate the need for deeper
NLP techniques to be developed which makes HappyDB an exciting resource for follow-on research
